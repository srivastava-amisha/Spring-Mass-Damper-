# Spring-Mass-Damper
This repository contains the implementation of a feedback control system for a spring-mass-damper model, a classic example used in control systems engineering. The project is developed as part of a control systems course and includes various Python scripts that simulate the dynamics, control, and visualization of the system's response.
